If you do not have the go command on your system, you need to Install Go first:
- [Binary installers and packages](https://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list)
- [Build from source and system requirements](http://golang.org/doc/install)

Declgrep greps just the declarations, exported and unexported,
excluding import declarations, of a given Go package,
or set of Go packages, with the standard build tags.

Declgrep runs an RE2-style regular expression against the names
of the declarations in one or more packages. The packages may be
specified as with the go(1) tool, including the special ...
operator. The -r flag searches both the specified package and
its dependencies, even when invoked with the ... operator.

The line number in the output is not guaranteed to be exact,
except in the case of functions. Exported and unexported
declarations are searched.
